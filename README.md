# work-scripts
Scripts created to remove tedium from a warehouse management job.

I was employeed to maintain a warehouse for a telecommunications company. It was a small satellite location staffed by me and my forklift. I had a few inventory systems to keep up to date. Some were simple enough, but others were incredibly annoying. I made these scripts, in AutoIT 3, to soften my fury for data entry.
